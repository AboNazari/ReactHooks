// useImperativeHandle is a hook that allows you to customize the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref. In most cases, you should not need to use this hook. It is designed to make it easier to use React with a third-party DOM library.

const UseImperativeHandle = () => {
    return (
        <div>UseImperativeHandle</div>
    )
}


export default UseImperativeHandle
